C++ Method Changes Summary

Component	Previous Version	Modified Version
postprocess()	Detected all targets and pushed each one to resultVector directly.	- Tracks objects using previous position (via MotionBasedTrackedBox)
- Stores all candidates in detected_boxes
- Handles logic for SINGLE or GROUP mode:<ul><li>SINGLE: select highest confidence box</li><li>GROUP: draw each box + surrounding group bbox</li></ul>
Tracking State	No memory of previous bboxes or motion.	Uses std::unordered_map<std::string, cv::Point> to track previous center of each label.
New helper function:
MotionBasedTrackedBox()	❌ Not present.	✅ Computes motion vector from previous center and moves box accordingly.
New helper function:
clipBox()	❌ Not present or incomplete.	✅ Ensures all bounding box coordinates stay within image bounds.
Enum TrackingMode	❌ Not available.	✅ Added enum TrackingMode { SINGLE, GROUP }; to control tracking behavior.
Mode Setter
setTrackingMode()	❌ Not present.	✅ Sets tracking mode (SINGLE or GROUP) from user code.
drawBoundingBox()	Only draws individual boxes.	✅ Now supports:<ul><li>Green box for individual object</li><li>Sky-blue box for group bbox if obj_id == -1</li></ul>
Usage in main/ROS	All detections shown equally.	Mode selected via:
yolo_detector.setTrackingMode(SINGLE); or GROUP

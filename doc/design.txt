## px System Flow (Pan/Tilt Tracking)
### Setup
1. Start Docker and pass the host camera through to the container (e.g., map /dev/video*).
2. Launch px2 (vision) and px3 (hardware) with the intended ROS 2 QoS profiles.
### Initialization
3. Center the servo(s): set each to 90° to define the origin (0 offset).
### Tracking Loop (repeats every frame)
4. Capture an image in px2 and run object detection.
5. Extract the bounding box (bbox) of the target.
6. Compute the pixel error: (bbox_center − image_center) for x (and y if 2-axis).
7. Convert error → angle: map pixel error to yaw/pitch degrees (using HFOV/VFOV).
8.Publish the target angle(s) from px2 → px3.
### Actuation
9. px3 receives the angle and sends the corresponding PWM command to the servo via Arduino/Telemetrix.
10. Servo rotates to the commanded angle.
### Continue
11. Repeat the loop to maintain tracking (with your SORT fallback/ID-lock as needed).
